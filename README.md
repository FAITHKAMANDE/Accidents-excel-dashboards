# PROJECT CLEANING 
# *1.Data Cleaning for Blank Spaces:*
This data cleaning process involves eliminating any empty spaces in the dataset where information was expected. This process ensures that the dataset is free from inconsistencies that may arise due to missing or improperly formatted data.
# *2.Data Consistency Check:*
After removing blank spaces, a thorough check was conducted to ensure the consistency and coherence of all the data fields. This verification process ensures that each piece of information in the dataset accurately corresponds to the context of traffic accidents, maintaining data integrity and reliability.
# *3.Temporal Grouping of Accident Dates:* 
To facilitate comprehensive analysis, the accident dates were methodically organized into specific year and month groups based on the date of occurrence. This grouping allows for a more structured examination of accident trends over time, enabling researchers to identify seasonal patterns or long-term trends in road safety.
# *4.Spelling and Data Quality Assurance:*
To maintain data accuracy and clarity, careful attention was paid to ensuring that all entries in the dataset, both in rows and columns, are correctly spelled and accurately represent the intended information. This meticulous quality assurance process helps mitigate errors and discrepancies that could compromise the reliability of the dataset during analysis.
# *5.Retention of All Original Columns:*
No columns were removed during the data processing phase, ensuring that all relevant information pertaining to traffic accidents is retained for analysis. This decision ensures that the dataset remains comprehensive and inclusive, providing researchers with a holistic view of the factors influencing road accidents.
# ANALYSING THE DATA.
The analysis process commences with the integration of Excel tables, consolidating pertinent data for comprehensive examination. Tables are merged using common identifiers, creating a cohesive dataset conducive to thorough study. 
This dataset undergoes meticulous review to ensure accuracy and completeness. Subsequently, tables are summarized to extract pivotal insights, leveraging functions to aggregate data points.

These summaries offer a wide range of perspective, aiding in the identification of trends, patterns, and outliers essential for informed decision-making. Furthermore, pivot tables are utilized to condense and visualize intricate data, facilitating deeper comprehension. This process of merging, validating, and summarizing data lays the foundation for insightful analysis, empowering effective decision-making across various domains.
By this analysis stakeholders can gain a comprehensive understanding of road accident patterns and drivers, enabling them to develop evidence-based strategies for improving road safety and reducing casualties.

With interactive features enabling users to filter, sort, and drill down into the data effortlessly, this Excel dashboard serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders in transportation management, urban planning, and public safety, facilitating informed decision-making and proactive measures to enhance road safety and mitigate risks.
# FINDINGS
# 1.Road Type Analysis:
- The data highlights single carriageways as the most frequent site of accidents, indicating a need for targeted safety measures on these roads.
-	Dual carriageways, though fewer in number compared to single carriageways, still account for a significant proportion of casualties.
-	One-way streets and slip roads contribute less to casualties, indicating potential areas for focused safety measures.
# 2.Vehicle Type Analysis:
-	Cars are involved in the highest number of casualties, followed by bikes and vans.
-	Agricultural vehicles have relatively fewer casualties, suggesting they might be less involved in accidents or are involved in less severe incidents.
# 3.Road Surface Analysis:
-	Accidents occur more frequently on dry surfaces compared to wet surfaces or snow/ice-covered roads.
-	Most casualties from both the rural and urban areas are recorded to have been in accidents from dry surfaces this can help in improving road maintenance and safety measures.
# 4.Monthly Trend Analysis (2021 vs. 2022):
-	There seems to be a decrease in casualties from 2021 to 2022, indicating potential improvements in road safety measures or changes in driving behavior.
-	The decrease in casualties from year 2021to 2022 is noticeable in many months, with the most significant drops occurring in January, April, August, and December.
# 5.Severity Analysis by Road Type:
-	Slight accidents in the year 2021 were the highest mostly occurring in the rural areas on single carriageway roads.
-	Carriageway roads in the rural areas as well as in the urban areas has a higher accident rates and prioritizing safety interventions accordingly can reduce the rate.
-	Roundabouts, one-way streets, and slip roads, while contributing fewer casualties individually, collectively make up a notable portion of the overall casualties.
# 6.Vehicle Type Distribution by Road Surface:
-	Cars have the highest slight casualties on dry surface roads followed by bikes on dry surface as well.
-	Wet surface has also reported slight casualties whereby cars top as the vehicle type.
-	Cars and bicycles are more prone to accidents on the dry surface which can inform driver and road maintenance strategies.
# 7.Monthly Trend Comparison by Road Type:
-	The single carriageway roads have the highest number of recorded casualties and this happened in both 2021 and 2022.
-	The single carriageway roads continue to lead each month with the highest number of casualties.
# 8.Correlation Analysis:
-	Cars show a very strong positive correlation with casualties, indicating that as the number of car-related casualties increases, casualties overall increase significantly.
-	The number of casualties shows very strong positive correlations with both dry and wet surface conditions, indicating that as the number of casualties under these weather conditions increases overall.
-	The number of casualties shows a strong positive correlation with single and dual carriageways, indicating that as the number of casualties on these road types increases, casualties overall increase as well.
# RECOMMENDATIONS
1.	Implement targeted safety measures on single carriageways, which are identified as the most frequent site of accidents.
2.	Focus safety interventions on dual carriageways despite their fewer numbers compared to single carriageways.
3.	Enhance safety measures on one-way streets and slip roads, which contribute less to casualties.
4.	Prioritize road maintenance and safety measures on dry surfaces where accidents occur more frequently.
5.	Continue efforts to decrease casualties through comprehensive road safety strategies.
6.	Implement targeted interventions at roundabouts, one-way streets, and slip roads to address specific safety concerns.
7.	Develop driver education and road maintenance strategies to address the higher accident rates of cars and bicycles on dry surfaces.
8.	Regularly monitor and evaluate road safety initiatives to assess effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
9.	Overall, these analyses can guide policymakers, transportation authorities, and safety organizations in implementing targeted measures to reduce road accidents and enhance road safety.
